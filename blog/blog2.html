                            <br>The global mobile app industry is growing rapidly today, with market expectations indicating a
                            48% uptick by the end of 2021. Notably, 64% of app downloads in the world take place in the
                            Asia-Pacific region alone. India is not only a vast market but also a provider of valuable tech
                            talent. This blog will discuss two widely used tools, Flutter and React Native, further detailing
                            the key reasons for pursuing app development as a career.
                            <br>So, read on to get familiar with the fundamental concepts and make an informed choice about
                            Flutter vs React Native.
                            <br>
                            <br>Usage of Flutter and React Native
                            <br>Flutter is a comprehensive software development toolkit packed with UI tools and widgets. It
                            uses the Dart programming language, enables cross-platform development, and allows developers to
                            build attractive Android and iOS applications with a single codebase.
                            <br>
                            <br>React Native is another open-source framework. It is based on JavaScript and React, offering the
                            fundamental UI building blocks for mobile applications. It is best to use external libraries while
                            creating web and desktop applications with React Native.
                            <br>
                            <br>While both software may seem similar in functionality, they have some differences. We have
                            listed them for you below.
                            <br>
                            <br>Differences between Flutter and React Native
                            <br>Flutter is a Google project, whereas Facebook developed React Native.
                            <br>React Native is older than Flutter. It was released in March 2015, while Flutter officially came
                            out in December 2018.
                            <br>Flutter uses Dart, and React Native uses JavaScript.
                            <br>Flutter is behind apps like Google Ads, Philips Hue, My BMW, Alibaba’s Xianyu. Facebook Ads,
                            <br>Instagram, Skype, and Tesla are built using React Native.
                            <br>App development with Flutter is faster than native development. React Native is as fast as
                            Flutter.
                            <br>However, it uses the bridge and native elements that may require different optimization, leading
                            to longer app development time.
                            <br>Now that you are clear about the uses and dissimilarities, we’ll look into each software
                            framework’s advantages and disadvantages.

                                <br>Pros and Cons of Flutter
                            </h2>
                            <br>
                            <br>Flutter is a clear winner in the Flutter vs. React Native debate for creating high-performance
                            apps.
                            <br>Its C++ engine and Skia graphic library pave the way for speedier coding and app development. It
                            <br>also provides exceptional testing features, which you can use for:
                            <br>
                            <br>Unit testing
                            <br>Integration testing
                            <br>Widget testing
                            <br>
                            <br>On the other hand, React Native demands third-party tools for mobile app testing.
                            <br>
                            <br>Moreover, as of 2021, Flutter’s code sharing advantages give developers the room to use the same
                            codebase for shipping native apps across five operating systems, including:
                            <br>
                            <br>Android
                            <br>iOS
                            <br>Windows
                            <br>macOS
                            <br>Linux
                            <br>
                            <br>Flutter apps imitate the native components, conforming to specific design languages, looking and
                            behaving naturally on each platform. The web experiences target browsers like Chrome, Firefox,
                            <br>Safari, and Edge. You can even embed the recently announced Flutter 2 in smart home appliances
                            and cars.
                            <br>
                            <br>Flutter’s primary disadvantage is that it uses Dart, a programming language with limited online
                            resources and rare usage among active programmers in the market. Additionally, the framework is more
                            suitable for straightforward applications that do not require extensive UI design.
                            <br>
                            <br>Pros and Cons of React Native
                            <br>The very fact that React Native uses JavaScript proves beneficial for aspiring mobile app
                            developers. JavaScript is widely used, easy to learn and implement, and can create simplified yet
                            rich interfaces.
                            <br>
                            <br>The React Native also delivers considerable cost and time savings. It allows integration with
                            third-party plugins and provides hassle-free state and lifecycle management, updating the app
                            components as the OS receives an update. The declarative programming employed by Reach Native makes
                            it easier to spot bugs on different user paths.
                            <br>
                            <br>Despite that, the framework lacks custom modules and a UI components library. It needs separate
                            native developer teams for Android and iOS apps. This can lead to inconsistency between the two
                            projects and major disparities in the apps’ features, appearance, and behavior. The resultant
                            applications’ could also be better in terms of navigation.
                            <br>
                            <br>Final Choice: Flutter vs. React Native In a nutshell, Flutter offers excellent documentation and
                            community support for both mobile and web platforms. It is mainly known for its swift time-to-market
                            length. React Native also boasts of a vast community and plenty of tutorials and libraries,
                            facilitating easy mobile app development. Both of these frameworks give you a rich codebase to work
                            with.
                            <br>
                            <br>However, here are a few caveats to keep in mind.
                            <br><b>Do not go for Flutter if:</b>
                            <br>You want to create a simple and small app instantly.
                            <br>It would help if you had a minimalistic UI and phone hardware (for taking pictures, playing
                            music,
                            <br>etc.)
                            <br>Your app design is platform-specific.
                            <br>Your app requires rare native libraries.
                            <br>Your app needs 3D touch support (it currently features on Flutter’s long-term roadmap.) Avoid
                            React Native in the following scenarios:
                            
                            <br>Your app has to perform ultra-specific tasks (for example, calculations) in the background.
                            <br>If you want to implement custom communication via Bluetooth.
                            <br>If you need an Android-only app, choose native app development instead. React Native provides
                            better support for iOS.
                            <br>Finally, it would help if you opted for the software that best aligns with your app requirements
                            and learning goals.
