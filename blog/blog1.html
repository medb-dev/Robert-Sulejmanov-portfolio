<br>Django is the Python web framework of choice for building web
applications. It’s a mature,
<br>full-featured, flexible and open-source framework that lets you
build anything from a simple CRUD
<br>application to a more complex, multi-app project like a
photo-sharing app.
<h2 class="uk-h2 uk-h2@m uk-width-3xlarge@m">
    <br>Requirements
</h2>
<br>You don’t need previous knowledge to set up a Django project. But Django
is a Python framework, so
<br>to use it you should have strong foundations using Python.
<br>
<br>Before starting, make sure you have a terminal or command prompt with
Python 3.6 or later installed.
<br>
<br>Most macOS and Linux systems have Python 3 installed by default, but if
you’re using Windows, you’ll
<br>need to download and install Python. You can follow this guide from the
official Python website.
<br>
<br>You can open a terminal by opening the applications finder of your
operating system and searching
<br>for Terminal, or on Windows, cmd.
<br>
<br>Open a terminal with application finder
<br>
<br>Once you’ve set up a terminal, it’s time to confirm your Python version.
To do this, type the
<br>following command:
<br><span class="text-code">python --version</span>
<br>Python 3.9.7 # My result
<br>If you didn’t get a result of the form Python 3.x, don’t panic. There
are two options:
<br>
<br>if python --version returned a Python 2.x version, you’ll need to use
python3 along with this
<br>tutorial. This usually happens with some macOS systems, as well as with
some Linux distros like
<br>Ubuntu. Try running the following command:
<br><span class="text-code">python3 --version
    <br>Python 3.9.7 # Again, my result</span>
<br>if you got an Unknown command error, tried to run python3, and still got
another error, you’ll need
<br>to download and install Python from the official website.
<br>
<br>Now that you know what Python command to run in your terminal, let’s
dive into Django projects.
<h2 class="uk-h2 uk-h2@m uk-width-3xlarge@m">
    <br>What’s a Django Project?
</h2>
<br>A Django project is a Python package needed to make a web application
work. It contains everything
<br>you need to build the backend (server-side development, what the users
don’t see) of your site. The
<br>normal functionality of a Django project determines how you interact
with the database,
<br>authentication, how data is retrieved, and so on.
<br>
<br>You can also think of it as a collection of settings, and small Python
modules named apps. We’ll
<br>talk about them later, but as a pre-concept, an app is another set of
Python files that solve a
<br>specific task of your app.
<br>
<br>Through this article, you’ll learn about the sophisticated structure of
a Django project. But from
<br>the start I want you to know that a Django project can be narrowed down
to a single file, something
<br>similar to a Flask project.
<br>
<br>A quick demonstration of this is the Minimal Django project. This is a
file with 23 lines of code
<br>that allows us to bring a Django “Hello, World!” project to life:
<span class="text-code">
    <br>import sys
    <br>from django.conf import settings
    <br>from django.urls import path
    <br>from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    <br>from django.http import HttpResponse
    <br>settings.configure(
    <br>DEBUG=True,
    <br>ROOT_URLCONF=sys.modules[__name__],
    <br>)
    <br>def index(request):
    <br>return HttpResponse(' < h1>A minimal Django response!</>')
    <br>urlpatterns = [
    <br>path(r'', index),
    <br>]
    <br>if __name__ == '__main__':
    <br>execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)</span>
<br>Now, a Django project can go much further. A great example is Instagram,
which has thousands of
<br>Django endpoints and still uses this framework for crucial
functionality.
<h2 class="uk-h2 uk-h2@m uk-width-3xlarge@m">
    <br>How to Set up a Django Project
</h2>
<br>Don’t worry too much if some of the following commands seem complex.
After you’ve created a couple
<br>of projects, you’ll know them like the back of your hand.
<br>
<br>First of all, you need to know that Django is an external package. In
other words, it doesn’t come
<br>built-in with Python, so you’ll need to install it with PIP.
<br>
<br>PIP is a package manager for Python, a tool that allows you to install
Python packages from the
<br>Python Package Index (PyPI).
<br>
<br>Now, before installing the actual Python package, you’ll need to create
a virtual environment. It’s
<br>a good practice to create a virtual environment for each Django project
you build, so you can keep
<br>track of dependencies.
<br>
<br>Maybe the code you have in a Django 2.6 project may not work with Django
3.0. A virtual environment
<br>lets you have specific requirements for each project you have.
<br>
<br>You can create a virtual environment named .venv (or whatever name you
want) with the following
<br>command:
<span class="text-code">
    <br>python -m venv .venv</span>
<br>Now, if you list the files in the current directory, you’ll see a new
folder called .venv, which at
<br>the same time contains isolated Python binaries:
<span class="text-code">
    <br>$ ls -lah .venv/
    <br>Permissions Size User Date Modified Name
    <br>drwxr-xr-x - daniel 10 nov 23:13 .
    <br>drwxr-xr-x - daniel 10 nov 23:13 ..
    <br>drwxr-xr-x - daniel 10 nov 23:13 bin
    <br>drwxr-xr-x - daniel 10 nov 23:13 include
    <br>drwxr-xr-x - daniel 10 nov 23:13 lib
    <br>lrwxrwxrwx 3 daniel 10 nov 23:13 lib64 -> lib
    <br>.rw-r--r-- 69 daniel 10 nov 23:13 pyvenv.cfg
</span>
<br>To active your virtual environment, you need to activate it with the
following command:
<br>source .venv/bin/activate
<br>This will only work on bash shells (available on macOS and Linux).


<br>Now, install the Django package. You can either install the latest or a
specific version of Django:
<br>
<br>pip install django # Latest version
<br>pip install django==2.2 # Specific version
<br>Start the project
<br>Once you’ve installed Django, to start a new project you call the
django-admin command-line utility
<br>and run:
<br>
<br>django-admin startproject < project_name>
    <br>It’s worth mentioning that some names are reserved for Django —
    django or django-admin. Don’t
    <br>worry if you get an error. Just try to use a different project name:
    <br> <br>django-admin startproject django
    <br># CommandError: 'django' conflicts with the name of an existing
    Python module and cannot be used
    <br>as a project name. Please try another name.
    <br>django-admin startproject django-admin
    <br># CommandError: 'django-admin' is not a valid project name. Please
    make sure the name is a valid
    <br>identifier.
    <br>A common practice is to name your project as config, and this has
    some advantages. First, it’s a
    <br>name that you can keep consistent across all of your projects, and
    second, normally the
    <br>“project” folder only stores configuration-related files. You can
    read more on the official
    <br>Django forum:
    <br> <br>django-admin startproject config
    <br>Django project structure
    <br>Once you’ve started a Django project, you’ll see a new folder with
    the name of the project you
    <br>chose, and a structure similar to this:
    <span class="text-code">
        <br>.
        <br>├── config
        <br>│ ├── config
        <br>│ │ ├── asgi.py
        <br>│ │ ├── __init__.py
        <br>│ │ ├── settings.py
        <br>│ │ ├── urls.py
        <br>│ │ └── wsgi.py
        <br>│ └── manage.py
        <br>└── .venv</span>
    <br>Let’s analyze each part in depth:
    <br>config/ is the external folder of your project. It doesn’t matter to
    Django, so you can actually
    <br>rename it to whatever you want.
    <br>config/config/ is the actual Django project folder. It contains the
    setting files of your
    <br>project.
    <br>manage.py is a Python script with the same functionality of
    django_admin but uses your project’s
    <br>settings.
    <br>__init__.py makes config/config a Python package.
    <br>settings.py is the core file of your project. You can add, modify,
    or delete variables to change
    <br>the behavior of your project.
    <br>urls.py is the file that defines the URLs of your project.
    <br>asgi.py and wsgi.py let you deploy your project to a server.
    <br>I know Django’s project structure may be a bit complex at the start,
    but with time, it starts to
    <br>just make sense. Every file has a purpose, and the development
    process becomes really pleasant.
    <br>A common shortcut is to omit the creation of the external folder.
    This is useful because you
    <br>won’t have to modify your project structure when deploying to
    something like Heroku:
    <br>django-admin startproject <project_name> .

        <br>So for example, for every Django project you start, you can run
        the following command:
        <span class="text-code">
            <br>django-admin startproject config .</span>
        <br>Try each command on your own, and decide which one is the best
        for you.
        <br>To finish this section, we’ll start the Django development
        server, and check that the project setup was successful.
        <br>Go to the root folder of your project (where manage.py is
        located) and start the server with this command:
        <br>python manage.py runserver Now, jump into your browser, type in
        localhost:8000/ and you should see Django’s default page.
        <h2 class="uk-h2 uk-h2@m uk-width-3xlarge@m">
            <br>How to Set up a Django App
        </h2>
        <br>As I told you earlier, a Django project is different from a
        Django app.
        <br>From the official docs: “An app is a Web application that does
        something”. That something is a specific functionality such as a
        user’s app, a comments app, a chat app.
        <br>The more feature-targeted your apps are, the better.
        <br>A Django application is self-contained, which means it can be
        reused from project to project. That’s why you can install an
        external app, like Django-allauth, and use it in your project, just
        by adding it to the INSTALLED_APPS variable.
        <br>You’ll spend most of your time working with apps, because, one
        by one, they build all the features of your project.
        <br>From now on, you’ll be using the manage.py utility, so to create
        an app, go to the root folder of your project and run the following
        command:
        <span class="text-code">
            <br>python manage.py startapp < app_name> </span>
        <br>Try to be as specific as possible with your app names. If you
        want to create an app for integrating payments with PayPal, or
        Stripe, name it simply payments:
        <br>python manage.py startapp payments
        <br>Let’s go in-depth into the structure of a Django app:
        <span class="text-code">
            <br> .
            <br> ├── config
            <br> │ ├ ...
            <br> ├── manage.py
            <br> └── payments
            <br> ├── admin.py
            <br> ├── apps.py
            <br> ├── __init__.py
            <br> ├── migrations
            <br> │ └── __init__.py
            <br> ├── models.py
            <br> ├── tests.py
            <br> └── views.py
        </span>
        <br> payments/ is the folder of your app.
        <br> admin.py is used to register the models into Django’s admin
        interface.
        <br> apps.py defines the app configuration.
        <br> models.py is used to store the models, which are the objects
        that we create to store and
        <br> control data.
        <br> migrations/ is the folder that contains the migration scripts
        of the app. You run
        <br> migrations to apply the changes of our models into a database.
        <br> tests.py is used to test the app.
        <br> views.py is the file where we define the views of our app. A
        view is a Python callable
        <br> that receives an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response.
        <br> Inside your apps, you can create other files and folders, and
        even build templates,
        <br> which are the Django way of displaying data dynamically on a
        web page.
        <br>

            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <br>Django is a full-battery web framework that lets you build any
        kind of application. Setting up a Django project is quick and easy,
        and you can start working on your project right away.
